# How To Contribute
## Report a Bug or Request a Feature

If you encounter any bugs while using this software, or want to request a new feature or enhancement, please [create an issue](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-python/issues) to report it, and make sure you add a label to indicate what type of issue it is.

## Contribute Code

Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes. If you want to implement something new, [please request a feature](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-python/issues) first so we can discuss it.

While writing your code contribution, make sure you follow the testing conventions found in the [tests directory](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-python/tree/main/tests) for any components that you add. We use [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/nylas/nylas-python) to test coverage, please ensure that your contributions don‚Äôt cause a decrease to test coverage.

## Creating a Pull Request

Please follow [best practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices) for creating git commits. When your code is ready to be submitted, you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to begin the code review process.

All PRs from contributors that aren't employed by Nylas must contain the following text in the PR description: "I confirm that this contribution is made under the terms of the MIT license and that I have the authority necessary to make this contribution on behalf of its copyright owner."
